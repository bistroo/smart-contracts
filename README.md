# Bistroo Settlement Contract
The first steps towards a decentralised Bistroo supply chain are set.
We created a first version of a escrow settlement contract for the decentralisation of the proces

Today weâ€™re releasing the open sourced and tested version of this solidity contract
It is relying on a BIST ERC777 token (with its special hooks) to facilitate the proces

We have visualised the proces in the schematics below
Also the demo run is visible in the terminal screenshot
